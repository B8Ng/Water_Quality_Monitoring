# Water_Quality_Monitoring
With the needs of water environment monitoring and the intelligent development of aquaculture, this paper designs a water quality data acquisition system based on the Internet of Things to solve the deficiencies of traditional monitoring systems in terms of real-time performance, communication distance and cost. In the system design, a hierarchical architecture of "perception layer - transmission layer - application layer" is adopted. The perception layer integrates sensors such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and TDS, as well as GPS modules to achieve parameter collection and positioning. The transport layer builds a star network through the LoRa protocol to achieve long-distance communication between nodes and gateways, and uses the MQTT protocol combined with 4G modules to complete the low-traffic and high-concurrency data interaction between gateways and servers. The application layer develops gateway node software based on FreeRTOS, realizes functions such as local interface data visualization and threshold early warning through LVGL, and designs a WeChat mini-program to provide remote interaction. The hardware gateway node adopts the STM32H750XBT6 main control, supporting dual power supply mode. The acquisition node uses the STM32F103C8T6 main control to adapt to various scenarios. Multi-task scheduling, data processing and two-way communication are realized on the software. The test shows that the parameter acquisition accuracy meets the standards, the transmission delay is low, and the communication is stable. The system has advantages such as low cost and easy maintenance, and can be applied in water area monitoring and aquaculture scenarios. In the future, the system can be further optimized, detection parameters can be expanded, and edge computing can be introduced to enhance the intelligence level, providing new ideas for intelligent applications.
